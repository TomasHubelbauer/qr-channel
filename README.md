# [QR Channel](https://tomashubelbauer.github.io/qr-channel/)

This is an experiment in using QR codes to establish WebRTC connection between devices equipped with web cams by exchanging the necessary
SDP messages required to establish a WebRTC connection.

This has been done before and I've attempted it several times before as well.

I am doing it again because I like the idea and I want to finally put forth a prototype of my own that I'll actually finish.
In the future I'd like to explore ways of bringing down the time required to establish the connection.
