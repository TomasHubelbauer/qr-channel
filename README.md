# [QR Channel](https://tomashubelbauer.github.io/qr-channel/)

This is an experiment in establishing WebRTC peer connection with a data channel between two devices equipped with web cams by
exchanging QR codes with offer/answer SDP data and ICE candidate data.

I also have a Web Bluetooth based solution in the works, [BT Channel](https://github.com/TomasHubelbauer/bt-channel).

## Running

Please note that the above badge corresponds to a strict TypeScript type check status.
There is no build per se as this is a static file JavaScript project hosted using GitHub Pages
with an [**online demo** at tomashubelbauer.github.io/qr-channel](https://tomashubelbauer.github.io/qr-channel/).

## Debugging

- Use the video and canvas views in portrait to be able to verify that video to canvas drawing works correctly
- Use the facing mode selector in portrait to switch between environment and use facing modes
  - The user mode is production screen-to-screen workflow where the user faces the phone to the laptop and the devices connect
  - The environment mode is debugging sequential workflow where the developer alternates the screens to guide the flow and debug
- Clear iOS Safari website cache: Settings > Safari > Advanced > Website Data > `tomashubelbauer.github.io` > swipe
- Make sure your iPhone is not in the power saver mode, otherwise camera access won't be granted to the page
- Make sure you are not using the camera in another browser/tab if Chrome gives you a blank stream (2Ã—2 pixels)

GitHub issues are closed, use a pull request to start discussion about a patch or email me at tomas@hubelbauer.net.

The PR will be type checked before it can be merged. This is a JavaScript project which uses JSDoc through TypeScript.

- [ ] Finalize PR blocking using Azure Pipelines

### Roadmap

Also see
[`TODO` comments](https://github.com/TomasHubelbauer/qr-channel/search?q=todo&unscoped_q=todo)
in the source code and MarkDown checkboxen
([GitHub can't find these](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-code/#considerations-for-code-search))
in all MarkDown files.

- [ ] Finalize `reply.js` using [the test rig](https://github.com/TomasHubelbauer/qr-channel/src/test/replying)
      and verify with real devices
- [ ] Test that the candidate `melt` function works in the coding test laying ground for the ICE compression/decompression
- [ ] Compress and decompress ICE in `encode` & `melt`, fit multiple into a QR code (limit to type number 5)
- [ ] Figure out [this problem](https://stackoverflow.com/q/53958469/2715716) and fix `jsQR` not being seen by TypeScript
  - [ ] See if jsQR maintainers [find a way](https://github.com/cozmo/jsQR/issues/108)
- [ ] Figure out why TypeScript `.d.ts` file in `node_modules` still get checked despite `skipLibCheck`
- [ ] See if it could be possible to pull the dependencies as ES native modules

### Prior Art

This has been done before and I've attempted it several times before as well.

- (2014) https://franklinta.com/2014/10/19/serverless-webrtc-using-qr-codes/
- (2015) https://github.com/phiresky/webrtc-remote-touch-pen-input
- (2018) https://github.com/AquiGorka/webrtc-qr

Unfortunately, this idea has also been patented in 2018:

https://patents.google.com/patent/US20160021148A1

The patent is invalid as there was prior art before the time of application,
but has been granted and overturning it would require a court challenge.
Until that happens, it's probably unsafe to use this in a commercial product.

I am doing it again because I like the idea and I want to finally put forth a prototype of my own that I'll actually finish.
In the future I'd like to explore ways of bringing down the time required to establish the peer connection.
