# [QR Channel](https://tomashubelbauer.github.io/qr-channel/)

This is an experiment in establishing WebRTC peer connection with a data channel between two devices equipped with web cams by
exchanging QR codes with offer/answer SDP data and ICE candidate data.

## Prior Art

This has been done before and I've attempted it several times before as well.

I am doing it again because I like the idea and I want to finally put forth a prototype of my own that I'll actually finish.
In the future I'd like to explore ways of bringing down the time required to establish the peer connection.
