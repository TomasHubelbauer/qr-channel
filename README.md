# [QR Channel](https://tomashubelbauer.github.io/qr-channel/)

This is an experiment in establishing WebRTC peer connection with a data channel between two devices equipped with web cams by
exchanging QR codes with offer/answer SDP data and ICE candidate data.

## Prior Art

This has been done before and I've attempted it several times before as well.

- (2014) https://franklinta.com/2014/10/19/serverless-webrtc-using-qr-codes/
- (2015) https://github.com/phiresky/webrtc-remote-touch-pen-input
- (2018) https://github.com/AquiGorka/webrtc-qr

Unfortunately, this idea has also been patented in 2018:

https://patents.google.com/patent/US20160021148A1

The patent is invalid as there was prior art before the time of application,
but has been granted and overturning it would require a court challenge.
Until that happens, it's probably unsafe to use this in a commercial product.

I am doing it again because I like the idea and I want to finally put forth a prototype of my own that I'll actually finish.
In the future I'd like to explore ways of bringing down the time required to establish the peer connection.
