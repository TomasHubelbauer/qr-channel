# [QR Channel](https://tomashubelbauer.github.io/qr-channel/)

This is an experiment in establishing WebRTC peer connection with a data channel between two devices equipped with web cams by
exchanging QR codes with offer/answer SDP data and ICE candidate data.

I also have a Web Bluetooth based solution in the works, [BT Channel](https://github.com/TomasHubelbauer/bt-channel).

## Running

Please note that the above badge corresponds to a strict TypeScript type check status.
There is no build per se as this is a static file JavaScript project hosted using GitHub Pages
with an [**online demo** at tomashubelbauer.github.io/qr-channel](https://tomashubelbauer.github.io/qr-channel/).

## Debugging

- Use the video and canvas views in portrait to be able to verify that video to canvas drawing works correctly
- Use the facing mode selector in portrait to switch between environment and use facing modes
  - The user mode is production screen-to-screen workflow where the user faces the phone to the laptop and the devices connect
  - The environment mode is debugging sequential workflow where the developer alternates the screens to guide the flow and debug
- Clear iOS Safari website cache: Settings > Safari > Advanced > Website Data > `tomashubelbauer.github.io` > swipe
- Make sure your iPhone is not in the power saver mode, otherwise camera access won't be granted to the page
- Make sure you are not using the camera in another browser/tab if Chrome gives you a blank stream (2Ã—2 pixels)

### Roadmap

Also see the `TODO` comments in the source code and MarkDown checkboxen in the other MarkDown files.

- [ ] Finalize `reply.js` using the test rig and verify with real devices
- [ ] Encode ICE to fit all sole QR code (expand as they come) and alternate the pair of SDP and ICE QR codes
- [ ] Change the SDP format to `(ID)(O/A/P/B)(hash)(ufrag):(pwd)` to drop the session ID length character
- [ ] Finalize the missing JSDoc annotations to clear out the TypeScript errors and remove the badge note above
- [ ] Find a way to make TypeScript see the packages even though I don't `import` them (ambient typings somehow)

## Crediting

### Prior Art

This has been done before and I've attempted it several times before as well.

- (2014) https://franklinta.com/2014/10/19/serverless-webrtc-using-qr-codes/
- (2015) https://github.com/phiresky/webrtc-remote-touch-pen-input
- (2018) https://github.com/AquiGorka/webrtc-qr

Unfortunately, this idea has also been patented in 2018:

https://patents.google.com/patent/US20160021148A1

The patent is invalid as there was prior art before the time of application,
but has been granted and overturning it would require a court challenge.
Until that happens, it's probably unsafe to use this in a commercial product.

I am doing it again because I like the idea and I want to finally put forth a prototype of my own that I'll actually finish.
In the future I'd like to explore ways of bringing down the time required to establish the peer connection.
